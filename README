The code is still very much in flux and not well commented at the moment.

Before building, the following src directories will need to be added to src/thirdparty (you could also add swc lib includes to the ant build file):

- minimal comps by bit101 (http://www.minimalcomps.com)
	* /src/thirdparty/com/bit101/...

to test using adl:

$ ant test

to build the air executable:

$ ant
